# Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd yourrepository
    ```

3. **Create a Python virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    If you're using Python 3.x and the `python` command doesn't work, try `python3` instead. 

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    On Windows:

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    On macOS and Linux:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Activating the virtual environment ensures that all subsequent Python commands are isolated within this environment.

5. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This command will install all the necessary dependencies for the project.
